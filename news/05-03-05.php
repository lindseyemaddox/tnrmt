	<h1>Success in Bedford County</h1>

	<h3>March, 2005</h3>

	<p>In 2002, our loss control team started working with general manager, Mr. Walter Bobo, and his staff. During these past few years, Mr. Bobo and staff, have proven their dedication to providing and maintaining a safe work environment. This utility district has formed a safety committee that meets on a regular basis. Each year, at Mr. Boboâ€™s request, our loss control team provides safety training in Confined Space Entry, Respiratory Protection, Trenching and Shoring, Defensive Driving, and Drug and Alcohol Awareness to all of his employees. We are pleased to report that Bedford County Utility District has not experienced a single lost time accident in the past three years. This reflects the effort of their employees that have helped create an injury free environment. Our loss control team appreciates the great attitudes and hard work that has been shown to us by all Bedford County Utility District employees.</p>
