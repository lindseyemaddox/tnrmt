	<h1>TNRMT Does More Than Handle Claims</h1>

	<h2>John Wilburn, Former Trust Administrator</h2>

	<h3>April, 2010</h3>

	<p>On January 28, 2010, TOSS and its Platinum Sponsors, The Tennessee Risk Management Trust and NGU Risk Management sponsored a very informative presentation at the Nashville Marriott to a group of more than thirty Directors and staff members concerning sexual harassment within the school as well as religious issues including the establishment and exercise clauses in the school setting. Dr. Keith Brewer indicated that comments received from attendees indicated this was one of the more informative sessions of the 2009- 2010 school year.</p>

	<p>Presenters for the CEO event included long term attorneys for the Trust, Charles Purcell of Waldrop and Hall of Jackson, TN and John Schwalb of Williams and Schwalb of Franklin, TN.</p>

	<p>TOSS and its Platinum Sponsors, TNRMT and NGU, hope to present more educational opportunities for TOSS members through various regional meetings. Watch for additional information from TOSS or its sponsors.</p>
