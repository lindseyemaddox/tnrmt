	<h1>TNRMT Gets New Website</h1>

	<h2><a class="fancybox fancybox.iframe" href="/bios/greenup.php">Kyle Greenup</a>, NGU Risk Management</h2>

	<h3>November, 2014</h3>

	<p>With help from NGU Risk Management, TNRMT has recently updated www.tnrmt.com.  Changes include a more streamlined navigation, search functions, updated photos & graphics, and mobile web compatibility.</p>

	<p>The website redesign simplifies the search for relevant information on the TNRMT website.  You’ll find every InTrust newsletter article on the site past and present, with future articles to be included.  We’ve also published updated forms for your use like our Workers’ Compensation Checklist.  You will also find state forms, such as Tennessee forms C20, C41, and C42G.  Contact information and an updated staff directory are included as well.</p>

	<p>In addition to the new website, we are in the planning phases of updating our claims reporting system in order to further streamline the reporting process.  Be sure to continue to read InTrust for more information in the future!</p>

	<p>If you haven’t already, please visit our new site!</p>
