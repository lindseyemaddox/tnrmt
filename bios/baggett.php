		<h1>Jason Baggett</h1>

		<h2>Loss Control Specialist</h2>

		<h3>Jason Baggett has a knack for solving problems and teaching others how to prevent injuries. In fact, he’s down right passionate about it. And as a loss control specialist for TNRMT, he focuses on providing safety training for school and county government employees, performing accident investigations, and inspecting schools for potentially dangerous conditions and fixing them.</h3>

		<h3>After earning his degree in occupational safety and health from Murray State University in Kentucky, he began his career in loss prevention within the insurance industry. And now with nearly 15 years of professional experience under his belt, he’s an expert on OSHA-related topics, accident prevention, and engineering practices, just to name a few. </h3>

		<h3>During a typical day, you can find him traveling throughout East Tennessee, relying on his outgoing and friendly nature and his faith to interact with others and truly understand each person, challenge, or claim that comes his way. In Jason’s time with TNRMT, he’s conducted safety training for more than 20,000 employees.</h3>

		<h3>“Any time someone needs me, I am there and always willing to help,” said Jason, who joined TNRMT in 2004. “I try to be thoughtful and considerate at all times, while really getting to know clients. The things that excite me most about my job are the people I work with every day and everyone who I’ve met along the way.”</h3>

		<h3>And when he isn’t working hard for his clients, Jason can be found enjoying the great outdoors, hunting throughout the Kentucky countryside, teaching others how to wakeboard and ski, or boating on Ft. Loudon Lake in his free time.</h3>

		<h2>Did You Know?</h2>

		<h3>The TNRMT loss prevention team goes way back. In fact, Jason grew up with the other loss prevention specialists, Chris and Mark. They’ve been friends since they were children. </h3>
