		<h1>Amie Alongi</h1>

		<h2>Loss Control Specialist</h2>

		<h3>As a claims specialist, Amie handles all the non-litigated property damage and liability claims for Safety Engineering Consultants. And whether it’s on the phone or in person, she has a knack for helping clients feel at ease while letting them know she’s there to answer their questions and find solutions. </h3>

		<h3>With 20 years of experience in the insurance industry, Amie understands that every claim is different, and she truly cares about her clients’ situations and always does everything she can to help guide them throughout the claims process. She values the importance of treating everyone fairly and with respect. Simply put, supporting and caring for others just comes naturally for her.</h3>

		<h3>And when’s she not in the office, you can find her spending time with her family, perfecting her shopping and photography skills, and supporting causes such as Make-A-Wish® and Blood:Water Mission. She’s also lived in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Ohio, Arizona, and California, but she’s proud to call Tennessee home and has no plans on leaving anytime soon. </h3>

		<h2>Did You Know?</h2>

		<h3>Amie is known for her love of cooking. In fact, she’s regularly caught in her kitchen in the middle of the night experimenting with a new recipe or perfecting a classic dish. It’s safe to say she makes one mean loaf of banana bread.</h3>
