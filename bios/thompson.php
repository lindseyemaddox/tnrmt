		<h2>Senior Claims Representative</h2>

		<h3>Sandra Thompson takes pride in her work. And as a claim representative for TNRMT, she helps clients fully understand their situations—and more important, she makes them feel at ease knowing their claims will be handled in a professional manner.</h3>
 
		<h3>“My clients know that I will do what it takes to get the job done, and I’ll always do it with a smile,” said Sandra, who is passionate about lifting people up and making them feel good about themselves. “My goal is for clients to be glad they can turn to us when it comes to their insurance needs.” </h3>
 
		<h3>With more than 30 years of experience in the insurance field, Sandra began her career focusing on life insurance. She then moved to the agency side and ended up in the world of workers’ compensation claims, where she enjoys investigating every angle of a claim for details so she can determine the best outcome for everyone involved.</h3>
 
		<h2>Did You Know?</h2>

		<h3>Sandra grew up on the outskirts off Boston, however she’s always felt that she should have been born a Southern child.</h3>
